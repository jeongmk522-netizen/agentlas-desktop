/**
 * Whether a goal that the host paused may pick itself up again.
 *
 * Quitting the app pauses every running goal with `automaticResume: false`, and startup pauses again
 * for the same reason. Nothing ever undid either, so a goal meant to run for days ended permanently
 * the first time the person closed the window — the state said "paused", and no code path in the
 * product could take it out of that state on its own.
 *
 * Auto-resume cannot simply be switched on, though: an attempt that was mid-flight when the host
 * died has an unknown side effect, and repeating it could send the same message or write the same
 * file twice. So the rule is narrow and provable: resume only a goal that was *between* turns.
 *
 * That is not a corner case, it is the common one. A long goal spends almost all of its life
 * between turns, which is exactly when a person closes their laptop.

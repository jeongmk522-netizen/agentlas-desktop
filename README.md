Connect the AI models you already pay for, import agents over MCP, and run whole
agent teams from one local window — with the org chart and the repo behind every
run in plain view. Your keys and your chat history stay on your machine, never on
someone else's agent platform.

- **Bring your own models.** Claude, Codex, and Gemini (CLI or API key), or
  OpenAI / Anthropic / Google directly. Agentlas never proxies the model call.
- **Import agents over MCP.** Drop in an agent or a whole team — for example a
  package you built on [agentlas.cloud](https://agentlas.cloud) — and run it.
- **See the team, not a black box.** Every agent team renders as an org chart and
  a file tree, so you can see who does what and which repo each run touches.
- **Run and orchestrate locally.** The app supervises the agent processes and
  routes work between roles, all on your disk.
- **Local-first.** Keys in the OS keychain, chats and installed agents in local
  SQLite. Open source, Apache-2.0 — fork it, audit it, ship a variant.

## Who it's for

- **Power users** who already pay for Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini and want to run
  agents on that subscription instead of paying a second AI bill to an agent SaaS.
- **Builders** who package agents on [agentlas.cloud](https://agentlas.cloud) and
  want to run them locally over MCP.
- **Privacy-minded teams** who refuse to hand their API keys and chat history to a
  third-party agent platform.
- **Tinkerers** who want an open-source, auditable, forkable agent runner.

## Features

A complete tour of what ships today.

### Bring your own everything (BYOC)

- **Local CLI runtimes, auto-detected.** Agentlas finds your installed
  `claude-code`, `codex`, and `gemini` CLIs and runs through them — using the
  subscription/login you already have. No re-auth, no copy-pasting keys.
- **BYOK cloud keys.** No CLI? Paste an Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google API key and
  go. Keys are stored in the OS keychain, never a file.
- **Mix and switch freely.** Have Claude Code *and* a Gemini key? Both show up; pick
  the active backend per run. Most apps lock you to one provider — Agentlas doesn't.
- **No proxy, ever.** Every model call goes straight from your machine to the
  provider. Agentlas runs no LLM of its own and adds **$0** to your model bill.

### Agent firms — teams, not a single bot

- **Install a whole company.** A *firm* is a CEO agent that delegates down to
  department heads and workers — e.g. a storefront-ops firm with content, CS, and
  analytics departments.
- **Live org chart.** Every firm renders as a hierarchy so you can see who reports
  to whom and which role handles what — no black box.
- **Chat the CEO, mobilize the team.** Message the CEO and it routes work to the
  right roles, or talk to any single specialist directly.

### Projects, chats, and history that stay yours

- **Projects** group related chats, apply a shared context note, and set a default
  agent so every new chat starts with the right context.
- **Chats** support rename, archive/unarchive, switching the bound agent, and full
  message history — all in **local SQLite**, nothing on a server.
- **Image attachments** are sent as multimodal input on BYOK backends.
- **Working-folder panel** pins a folder to a chat with a read-only file tree and
  text preview, so you can see the repo an agent is helping with.

### Install agents over MCP — a real marketplace

- **MCP-native installs.** Browse and install agents and whole firms from the
  `agentlas.cloud` marketplace; they run through local runtime adapters over the
  Model Context Protocol.
- **Trust grades.** Listings carry a trust grade; sideloading unvetted agents is
  gated.
- **Works offline.** An in-memory fallback source keeps the marketplace usable when
  the network or cloud is down.

### Library — manage the whole toolbox

- **Agents, Skills, MCP servers, and a shared env-var vault** in one place. The
  vault tracks which environment variables each agent needs and which are set —
  values live in the keychain, the UI only shows whether a key exists.

### Automations

- **Schedule recurring runs** against an agent or a firm from a prompt template.
  (UI ships in the current M0 build; the persistent scheduler lands in V1.)

### Migrate in — never locked in

- **Import from OpenClaw and Hermes** in one click: SOUL/persona → an agent, `.env`
  keys → the keychain, scheduled jobs → automations, memories → a project. Dry-run
  and overwrite supported. Secret values never leave the main process.
- **Apache-2.0 open source.** Audit it, fork it, ship your own variant.

### Local-first security

- API keys and tokens live in the **macOS/Windows/Linux keychain** via the main
  process — never a plaintext file, never readable by the renderer/UI.
- Chats, projects, firms, and installed agents live in **local SQLite**.

### Cross-platform, self-updating, bilingual

- **macOS (arm64 + Intel), Windows (installer + portable), Linux (AppImage + deb).**
- **Auto-updates** via a GitHub Releases feed — a "Restart to update" badge appears
  when a new build is downloaded.
- **Full Korean / English UI** with automatic locale detection.

## How Agentlas compares

Three common ways to run AI agents today — and where Agentlas lands.

| | **Agentlas Desktop** | Hosted agent platform (SaaS) | Single-model desktop chat | Raw terminal CLI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Where model calls go | **Direct from your machine** | Through their servers | Direct | Direct |
| Who pays for tokens | **Your existing sub / key** | Platform fee **+** tokens | Your sub / key | Your sub / key |
| Where keys & history live | **Your keychain + local SQLite** | Their cloud | Local (varies) | Local |
| Multi-agent firms + org chart | **Yes** | Sometimes | No | No (manual) |
| Install 3rd-party agents over MCP | **Yes, marketplace** | Varies | No | Manual |
| Use local CLIs (Claude Code / Codex / Gemini) | **Yes** | Rarely | No | One at a time |
| Mix CLIs **and** cloud keys in one window | **Yes** | No | No | No |
| Open source (Apache-2.0) | **Yes** | Usually no | Varies | Varies |
| Desktop GUI on mac / win / linux | **Yes** | Web only | Often | No (terminal) |

**Why people pick Agentlas**

- **It runs on the AI you already pay for.** No second subscription to an agent
  platform — your Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini plan does the work.
- **Your data never leaves your machine.** Keys in the OS keychain, chats in local
  SQLite, model calls direct to the provider. Nothing to trust us with.
- **Teams of agents, visible.** Firms with a real org chart beat a single opaque
  chatbot when work needs more than one role.
- **Open and portable.** Apache-2.0, importable from OpenClaw/Hermes, forkable — no
  lock-in.

## Screens

| Screen | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Home** | Landing dashboard — recent chats, installed teams, quick actions. |
| **Chat** | One-on-one conversation with an agent or a firm's CEO. Supports image attachments on BYOK backends. |
| **Archived chats** | Chats you've archived — hidden from the sidebar, restorable anytime. |
| **Projects** | Create and open projects; each carries a default agent and a shared context note. |
| **Firm detail** | The agent company's org chart — CEO → department heads → workers, plus the firm persona. |
| **Automations** | List, create, and toggle scheduled runs targeting an agent or a firm. |
| **Library · Agents** | Installed agents, their tone/persona, and trust grade. |
| **Library · Skills** | Skills available to your installed agents. |
| **Library · MCPs** | Installed MCP servers and their manifests. |
| **Library · Env** | The shared environment-variable vault — which keys are set and which agents require them. |
| **Marketplace** | Browse and install agents and firms from `agentlas.cloud` (with an offline in-memory fallback). |
| **Settings** | Backend connections, BYOK API keys, language, and migration from OpenClaw / Hermes. |
| **Onboarding** | First-run wizard: welcome → connect a backend → menu tour → install your first team. |

## LLM Providers

Agentlas connects to models two ways — through a **local CLI** you already have
installed, or with a **cloud API key (BYOK)**. Either way the call goes straight
from your machine to the provider; Agentlas never sits in the middle.

| Provider | How it connects | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | Local CLI (`claude-code`) | Auto-detected. Uses your existing Claude subscription/login. |
| **Codex** | Local CLI (`codex`) | Auto-detected. Uses your existing ChatGPT/OpenAI login. |
| **Gemini** | Local CLI (`gemini`) | Auto-detected. Uses your existing Google login. |
| **Anthropic** | BYOK API key | `console.anthropic.com → API Keys`. Stored in the OS keychain. |
| **OpenAI** | BYOK API key | `platform.openai.com/api-keys`. Stored in the OS keychain. |
| **Google (Gemini)** | BYOK API key | `aistudio.google.com/app/apikey`. Stored in the OS keychain. |

You need **one** of these to start — a single detected CLI or a single API key.
Add more later in **Settings**.

## Quick install

Get the latest build from the [**Releases page**](https://github.com/jeongmk522-netizen/agentlas-desktop/releases/latest).

| OS | File | Notes |
|----|------|-------|
| macOS (Apple silicon) | `Agentlas-x.y.z-arm64.dmg` | M1 and newer |
| macOS (Intel) | `Agentlas-x.y.z-x64.dmg` | Intel Macs |
| Windows | `Agentlas-Setup-x.y.z.exe` · `Agentlas-x.y.z-portable.exe` | Windows 10/11 (x64) |
| Linux | `Agentlas-x.y.z.AppImage` · `Agentlas-x.y.z.deb` | x64 |

### Install from the terminal

Prefer the command line? These one-liners fetch the latest release asset straight
from GitHub (no need to hardcode a version).

**macOS** (auto-detects Apple silicon vs Intel):

```bash
arch=$([ "$(uname -m)" = "arm64" ] && echo arm64 || echo x64)
url=$(curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/jeongmk522-netizen/agentlas-desktop/releases/latest \
  | grep -o "https://[^\"]*-${arch}\.dmg" | head -1)
curl -fL "$url" -o Agentlas.dmg && open Agentlas.dmg
```

**Linux (.deb — Debian/Ubuntu):**

```bash
url=$(curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/jeongmk522-netizen/agentlas-desktop/releases/latest \
  | grep -o 'https://[^"]*\.deb' | head -1)
curl -fL "$url" -o agentlas.deb && sudo dpkg -i agentlas.deb
```

**Linux (AppImage — any distro):**

```bash
url=$(curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/jeongmk522-netizen/agentlas-desktop/releases/latest \
  | grep -o 'https://[^"]*\.AppImage' | head -1)
curl -fL "$url" -o Agentlas.AppImage && chmod +x Agentlas.AppImage && ./Agentlas.AppImage
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
$r = Invoke-RestMethod https://api.github.com/repos/jeongmk522-netizen/agentlas-desktop/releases/latest
$u = ($r.assets | Where-Object { $_.name -like 'Agentlas-Setup-*.exe' }).browser_download_url
Invoke-WebRequest $u -OutFile "$env:TEMP\AgentlasSetup.exe"; Start-Process "$env:TEMP\AgentlasSetup.exe"
```

(With the GitHub CLI on any OS: `gh release download -R jeongmk522-netizen/agentlas-desktop --pattern '*.dmg'`.)

### Updates — do I need to reinstall?

No. The app updates itself: ~15s after launch and then hourly it checks GitHub
Releases, downloads a newer build in the background, and shows a **"Restart to
update"** badge (the same idea as Codex's update button). Click it to apply.

- **Windows:** auto-update works for the **installer** build (`Agentlas-Setup-*.exe`).
  The **portable** `.exe` does **not** self-update — re-download it to upgrade.
- **macOS / Linux (AppImage):** self-update in place. The `.deb` updates via the
  same in-app flow.

### First-time setup — opening the app the first time

Agentlas Desktop is open source and the public builds aren't paid code-signed on
every platform, so your OS may ask you to confirm the first launch. This is normal
for indie/open-source apps and happens only once.

**macOS** — if you see *"Agentlas can't be opened because Apple cannot check it
for malicious software"*, right-click the app in Applications → **Open** →
**Open**. Or, in Terminal:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Agentlas.app
open /Applications/Agentlas.app
```

**Windows** — if SmartScreen shows *"Windows protected your PC"*, click
**More info** → **Run anyway**. The portable `.exe` runs without installing.

**Linux** — make the AppImage executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x Agentlas-*.AppImage
./Agentlas-*.AppImage
# no FUSE on your distro? run:
./Agentlas-*.AppImage --appimage-extract-and-run
```

(Or install the `.deb`: `sudo dpkg -i Agentlas-*.deb`.)

## Getting Started

After installing, the first-run wizard walks you through it — but here's the whole
flow:

1. **Open the app** and let the welcome screen finish (first launch only).
2. **Connect a backend.** Agentlas auto-detects any installed `claude-code`,
   `codex`, or `gemini` CLI. No CLI? Paste an Anthropic / OpenAI / Google API key —
   it goes straight into the OS keychain.
3. **Install a team or an agent** from the **Marketplace**. Try a firm (a CEO plus
   its departments) or a single specialist.
4. **Start a chat** from the sidebar. Pick the agent (or the firm's CEO) and type.
5. **Pin a working folder** (optional) so the agent can see the repo it's helping with.
6. **Add automations** for recurring runs, and manage everything from **Library**.
7. **Coming from OpenClaw or Hermes?** Jump to
   [Migrating from OpenClaw](#migrating-from-openclaw) to bring your SOUL, keys,
   and automations across.

## CLI runtime vs Cloud (BYOK) — quick reference

Agentlas has no separate "CLI app" and "web app" — it's one desktop window. The
choice that matters is **how each run reaches a model**: through a local CLI you've
already logged into, or through a cloud API key you paste in. Both run from your
machine; here's how they differ.

| Action | Local CLI runtime | Cloud API key (BYOK) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Connect | Auto-detected (`claude-code` / `codex` / `gemini`) | Paste a key in **Settings → BYOK** |
| Who pays | Your existing subscription / login | Your API account, metered per token |
| Where the key lives | The CLI's own login | The OS keychain (never a file) |
| Works offline-ish | Whatever the CLI supports | No — direct cloud calls |
| Image attachments | Ignored by the CLI (a warning is shown) | Sent as multimodal input |
| Switch active backend | **Settings** → pick a detected runtime | **Settings** → pick a saved key |
| Version pinning | Follows the installed CLI version | Follows the provider's API |

> Agentlas never routes either path through its own servers. The model call goes
> from your machine straight to Anthropic / OpenAI / Google.

## Migrating from OpenClaw

Already running a terminal-style assistant like **OpenClaw**? Bring it across in the
app — **Settings → 다른 도구에서 가져오기 (Import from another tool)**.

Agentlas scans `~/.openclaw` and shows a preview (names and counts only — no secret
values ever leave the main process). Click **Import** and it brings over:

- **Your agent's SOUL / persona** (`workspace/SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`) → a new installed agent you can chat with immediately.
- **API keys** from `~/.openclaw/.env` → the OS keychain. Recognized provider keys
  (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, …) become BYOK backends;
  other `*_API_KEY` / `*_TOKEN` secrets go into the shared env vault.
- **Scheduled jobs** (`cron/jobs.json`) → automations targeting the imported agent.
- **Memories / workspace** → a "OpenClaw 마이그레이션" project whose context note
  points at your original workspace so you can pin it as a working folder.

Options:

- **Dry run** — preview exactly what would be imported, writing nothing.
- **Overwrite** — re-import on top of a previous import (updates the agent in place).

> Imported automations are session-only in the current M0 build; the persistent
> scheduler lands in V1. Everything else (agent, keys, project) persists.

### Migrating from Hermes

The same importer reads **Hermes** (`~/.hermes`, or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes` on
Windows): `SOUL.md` and workspace instructions become the agent persona, `.env`
keys go to the keychain, and `memories/` are surfaced as a project. Pick **Hermes**
in the same Settings panel.

## Build from source

Requirements: Node.js 20+, npm. (macOS also needs Xcode Command Line Tools, and
Linux needs `libsecret-1-dev`, for the native modules.)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeongmk522-netizen/agentlas-desktop.git
cd agentlas-desktop
npm install
npm run dev        # Next.js renderer on :3100 + Electron
```

```bash
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript for electron main + renderer
npm run build      # export renderer + compile electron into dist/
```

Package an installer (unsigned — fine for local use):

```bash
npm run dist:win            # Windows: NSIS installer + portable .exe
npm run dist:linux          # Linux: AppImage + .deb
npm run dist:mac:unsigned   # macOS: unsigned .dmg (no Apple cert needed)
```

Output lands in `release/`. Releases for the public download page are built by
the cross-platform GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) on a
tag push — see [`docs/PUBLIC-RELEASE.md`](docs/PUBLIC-RELEASE.md). End users don't
need any of that.

## Architecture

The renderer never gets direct filesystem, keychain, or process-supervision
access — it talks to the main process through a typed preload bridge.

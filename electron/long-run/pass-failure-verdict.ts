/**
 * What a failed continuation pass means for the goal that is driving it.
 *
 * A goal-driven run used to end the moment any pass failed: the loop threw, nothing scheduled a
 * successor, and the person saw a multi-hour goal die on a transient hiccup. Measured against a real
 * long-running orchestration on this machine (189 turns over 25.9 hours), four turns failed —
 * a model at capacity, two unsupported-parameter errors, and a usage limit — and the work continued
 * past every one of them. Surviving a failed turn is not a nicety; it is the difference between a
 * run that lasts an hour and one that lasts a day.
 *
 * The decision is made from the typed failure marker, never from the wording of the notice, because
 * vendor wording changes on every release and a run must not start dying because a sentence moved.
